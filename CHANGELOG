Version 3.0.1
- Added new method hasActiveDownloads(includeAddedDownloads: Boolean, func: Func<Boolean>)


Version 3.0.0
*Version 3 comes with a lot of enhancements and fixes*

  Fetch:
- FetchGroupListener. FetchGroupListener extends from FetchListener and allows you to listener for
  updates on a group. The methods on FetchGroupListener will return a FetchGroup object that contains
  all the downloads in a group and will inform you which download triggered a change on the group. Also see AbstractFetchGroupListener.
- Added new method to rename a completed download's file. see Fetch.renameCompletedDownloadFile method.

  Observers:
- Introducing FetchObserver. Fetch now allows you to subscribe from updates for a single Download or a Group of Downloads.
  Using the FetchObserver and FetchGroupObserver interface respectively. See Fetch.attachFetchObserversForDownload(id, observers...) documentation
  for more information. Also check the sample app for usage.
- Introducing FetchGroup. FetchGroup is an object that contains all information about a group Fetch manages. The group is
  automatically updated any time a download from the group updates. You can subscribe to FetchGroup's using the FetchGroupObserver.
  FetchGroupObservers attached to a FetchGroup will be notified when downloads on a group changes. You will be notified of
  the Reason for the change as well. See Fetch.getFetchGroup(id, callback) documentation for more information.

  Database:
- Fetch now allows you to provide your own database manager to manage downloads. See the FetchDatabaseManager documentation and
  FetchConfiguration.Builder class to get started. Note: Fetch depends on your FetchDatabaseManager methods to be synchronized to work correctly.

  Download:
- Added new fields on the Download objects. Fields: etaInMilliSeconds, downloadedBytesPerSecond. See documentation.

  Fixes & Small Improvements:
- You can now set the Handler Fetch will use to perform all operations on. See FetchConfiguration.Builder.setHandler method.
- Fixed a bug that prevented notification buttons (pause, cancel, resume, etc) from firing the intent.

Version 2.3.6
- Out of Memory Error. Fixed issued in the downloader where an out of memory error would occur.

Version 2.3.5
- Fetch methods removeAllInGroupWithStatus, deleteAllInGroupWithStatus, getDownloadsInGroupWithStatus
  have been updated to allow more than one Status to be queried or actioned upon. See Java doc for details
  . Special thanks to Marcin Adamczewski for submitting PR.
- Fetch logging is now disabled by default and can be enabled with the FetchConfiguration method. `.enableLogging(true)`
- The Error enum object now has a new field attach `httpResponse`. This response object contains the HttpCode and other
  http related information. This field is only provided when an error occurs and it is related to the Http response.
- Fixed EnqueueAction.UPDATE_ACCORDINGLY that caused the onComplete listener method to be called if the newly enqueued request
  was previously downloaded and completed but the file on the storage system was delete.

Version 2.3.4
- Added default cookie manager for the okhttp and httpurlconnection client Downloaders.
- Fixed an EnqueueAction.INCREMENT_FILE_NAME bug where files were not properly created.
- Download, Request, DownloadBlock and other data classes now extend Serializable.
- Okhttp and HttpUrlConnection clients now add a default Referer header to each request if
  one is not provided. Default Referer is the host of the url passed in the request.
- Behavior change and Updates for ActiveDownloads method on Fetch. The ActiveDownload method
  can now only be called on threads other than the Main(UI) Thread. The ActiveDownload method
  now correctly return true if there are active downloads. Downloads with a queued or Downloading status.
  Note: Calling this method on a UI thread will throw a FetchException.
- Added new awaitFinish methods on Fetch. The awaitFinish method blocks the current non UI thread
  until Fetch has completed all enqueued downloads. The awaitFinishTimeout method takes in a time in milliseconds
  to release the hold if Fetch has not completed all downloads in the allocated timeframe.
  Passing 0 to the awaitFinishTimeout method will hold the thread indefinitely(Never releasing).
  Recommend to use the awaitFinishTimeout method inside Android Workers and release the task when a certain amount of time has passed. See Java docs for details.
  Note: Calling this method on a UI thread will throw a FetchException.

Version 2.3.3
- Fixed return type of Downloader interface method onPreClientExecute. Now returns Void correctly.

Version 2.3.2
- Downloader interfaces and classes that extend Downloader now have a new method called onPreClientExecute(client: T, request: Downloader.ServerRequest): R?
  This method allows you to specify settings on the client before executing the request.
- Fixed resume bug with Parallel downloader

Version 2.3.1
This is the first stable version of Fetch 2. Enjoy.
- Fixed an issue where the priority queue backoff would not work correctly.
- Fixed an issue where request with a file uri would not resume correctly.
- Fixed an issue where the Fetch database would crash on large group calls.
- Added new method fun fileExists(file: String): Boolean on StorageResolver.
- Added new method getServerResponse for Fetch and RxFetch.
- Fixed an issue where completed download notifications using the DefaultNotificationManager would
  show the progress bar when a download completed.

Version 2.3.0-RC1
This version has lots of changes, improvements and bug fixes. Please read carefully.

New
1. Fetch now supports notifications via the FetchNotificationManager interface.
   See DefaultFetchNotificationManager class and sample code on usage.
2. Fetch now supports saving downloads to URI paths via StorageResolver.
   See sample code and DefaultStorageResolver class for usage.

- New constructor added for Request object. Request(url, Uri)
- New get method added on Request object. request.getFileUri()
- New get method added on Download interface. download.getFileUri()
- New set method added on FetchConfiguration.Builder class. builder.setStorageResolver(storageResolver)
- New set method added on FetchConfiguration.Builder class. builder.setNotificationManager(fetchNotificationManager)
- New interface added FetchNotificationManager. See java Docs.
- New class added DefaultFetchNotificationManager. See java Docs.
- New interface added StorageResolver. See javaDocs.
- New class added DefaultStorageResolver. See java Docs.

Bug Fixes
- Improvements and bug fixes to Parallel and Sequential file downloader.
- Fixed an issue where the onCompleted method would not be called for downloads with unknown content length.
- Fixed bug where EnqueueAction.DO_NOT_ENQUEUE_IF_EXISTING would throw an exception when it should not.
- Improvements to EnqueueAction.Update_ Accordingly
- Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements.

Breaking Changes
- The Fetch and RxFetch List enqueue method now has a new signature.
fun enqueue(requests: List<Request>, func: Func<List<Pair<Request, Error>>>? = null): Fetch
See Java Docs for more information. The new signature allows for the case where a request may fail
to enqueue but other request are still enqueued instead of the whole operation being terminated.
If the Error is Error.NONE this means that the download was successfully enqueued. Otherwise
this means that the enqueue for the request failed.
- In order to make Fetch more modular and accommodating to different application environments,
 the following methods were removed from the Downloader interface and are now on the StorageResolver interface.
 If you are overriding these methods, you must extend the StorageResolver interface or DefaultStorageResolver class
 and set an instance on the Fetch Configuration builder you are using to create your Fetch instance.
 Methods Moved:
 fun getRequestOutputResourceWrapper(request: Downloader.ServerRequest): OutputResourceWrapper
 fun getDirectoryForFileDownloaderTypeParallel(request: Downloader.ServerRequest): String

  Breaking Changes. The extras field on Request, CompletedDownload, FileResource has all been updated to use Extras object. Existing extras maps (Map<String, String) are migrated to
  the new extras object automatically.
- Added new Fetch and RxFetch method fun replaceExtras(id: Int, extras: Extras, func, func2) to replace the extras
  on an existing request/download stored in the Fetch database.

Version 2.1.0-RC1
This version of Fetch contains many fixes and breaking changes.
Note: Uses will not lose downloads migrating to this version once the same namespace is set.
There are no behavioral changes in the way requests are downloaded.
Changes include method renaming and moving classes into a different packages. New in this
version of Fetch is the release of the FetchFileServer. See demo in sample app. The wiki for this repo will be updated
over the coming days.

Changes:
- Logger, Downloader, Func, Func2 and FetchLogger classes moved to com.tonyodev.fetch2core
- OkHttpDownloader class moved to com.tonyodev.fetch2okhttp. Add this dependency implementation "com.tonyodev.fetch2okhttp:fetch2okhttp:2.1.0-RC1" to your build.gradle file. 
- Fetch.Builder and RxFetch.Builder classes has been removed and is replaced with FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- To get an instance of Fetch call Fetch.Impl.getInstance(fetchConfiguration)
  or RxFetch.Impl.getInstance(fetchConfiguration) to get a new instance.
- You can now get a default instance of Fetch by calling Fetch.Impl.getDefaultInstance(). Be sure to set
  the default FetchConfiguration at least once before calling the getDefaultInstance() method. To set the default configuration
  call Fetch.Impl.setDefaultInstanceConfiguration(fetchConfiguration)
- To set a custom Http Downloader for Fetch, call setHttpDownloader(downloader) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- To set the namespace of a Fetch instance, call setNamespace(namespace) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- New method enableMd5Check(enabled) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder. If supported by the server, Fetch will check
  the md5 checksum after a download completes and will report errors if the md5 checksum does not match.
- You can now have multiple instance with the same namespace. All Fetch instances with the same namespace will
  be updated automatically.
- Closing an instance of Fetch no longer causes crashes and releases all resources when appropriate.
- Fetch Listeners are now held as weak references to reduce memory leaks.
- Fetch Listener onQueued method has been updated to onQueued(Download download, boolean waitingOnNetwork)
- New Kotlin friendly methods added to Fetch for enqueuing requests and querying download information.
- Request class now has an enqueueAction field which replaces RequestOptions.
- RequestOptions enum was removed and replaced with EnqueueAction enum. There are two EnqueueAction types available.
  REPLACE_EXISTING and INCREMENT_FILE_NAME. Each new Request has a default enqueue action of REPLACE_EXISTING
  which will replace any existing request that Fetch is managing with the same File. If INCREMENT_FILE_NAME
  is set on the request, Fetch will auto increment the file name for the request and return the updated
  request in the first callback of the enqueue method. Be sure to update your external request references
  with the updated request.
- Request class no longer allows you to set the id field of a request. Request class has new field called identifier.
  Use the identifier(Long) field to set your own unique id to identify a request or download.
- New enqueueAction and identifier  fields added on Download and Request class.
- Logging is now enabled by default in Fetch
- Fetch Error 12 and 14 removed. No longer needed because of EnqueueAction simplicity.

FetchFileServer
- Introducing the FetchFileServer. The FetchFileServer is a lightweight TCP File Server that acts like
  an HTTP file server designed specifically to share files between Android devices. You can host file resources
  with the FetchFileServer on one device and have Fetch download Files from the server
  on another device. See sample app for more information. Wiki on Fetch File Server will be
  added in the coming days.
- To download files from a FetchFileServer using Fetch, set a custom file server downloader on the
  FetchConfiguration.Builder class by calling the setFileServerDownloader(fileServerDownloader) method.
  The com.tonyodev.fetch2downloads package already contains a custom downloader called
  FetchFileServerDownloader that you can use and extend.
- You can also use the FetchFileServer without having to use Fetch to download files hosted by the
  file server. See the FetchFileResourceDownloadTask class inside the com.tonyodev.fetch2downloads
  package for more details.
